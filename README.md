# Road Node System

The whole road node system is contained within two files:
* RoadNodeSystem.cs - This file contains the road node system code.
* RoadNodeEditor.cs - This file contains the road node system GUI code. It provides a custom GUI layer that can be used to manipulate the road node system, placed in the world.

Please note: due to Unity's requirements the *RoadNodeEditor.cs* file needs to be placed in a dir called *"Editor"*, for the custom layer to work properly.
